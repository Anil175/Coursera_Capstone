We get this information from wikipedia page(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\") and its corresponding latitude and longitudes data from this link' http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data'.\n\nTo explore and target recommended locations across different venues according to the presence of indian restaurants, For this we will access wikipedia page and scrape it into pandas dataframe and merge the dataframe with geospatial data to get latitude and logitude data for each neighborhood,then by using Four squares API I am going to get the nearby venues for each neighborhood and then plot the distribution of the venues across the neighborhood. Then cluster the neighborhoods based on the frequency of indian restaurants. So that we are able to recommand best locality to start an indian restaurant.\n\n## Methodology\n\n\nThe Methodology section will describe the main components of our analysis and predication system. The Methodology section comprises four stages:\n\n1. Collect Required Data\n2. Explore and Understand Data\n3. Data preparation and preprocessing \n4. Modeling"
